## 🎯 Project Objectives
This project aims to build a comprehensive end-to-end image classification pipeline using the **Intel Image Classification** dataset. The key objectives are:
- **Automated Data Processing:** Implementing automated download, extraction, data auditing, and cleaning (including corrupt file removal, resolution validation, and duplicate detection via perceptual hashing).
- **Dataset Standardization:** Establishing a robust and standardized train/validation/test split alongside comprehensive metadata tracking.
- **Traditional Machine Learning:** Experimenting with handcrafted feature extraction techniques (HOG, SIFT with Bag-of-Visual-Words) coupled with traditional classifiers (Linear SVM, Logistic Regression).
- **Deep Learning Feature Extraction:** Leveraging transfer learning using a pre-trained ResNet18 model for advanced feature embedding, followed by classification using traditional algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation:** Conducting quantitative performance evaluations utilizing accuracy metrics, weighted F1-scores, detailed classification reports, and confusion matrices.

## 🚀 Instructions for Running the Notebook

### Required Libraries
Ensure the following libraries are installed (detailed in `requirements.txt`):
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `torch`, `torchvision`
- `Pillow`, `ImageHash`

### How to Download Data and Run the Code

**Option A: Import this repository to Google Colab**
1. Open up a new Google Colab notebook and clone the repository directly inside the notebook:
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/PhatLavar/ML_ASSIGNMENT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to `notebooks/main.ipynb` or execute the core modules.
The code is designed to automatically install dependencies, download the dataset using `gdown`, and run the entire pipeline correctly within the Colab environment.

**Option B: Use the Standalone Notebook**
1. Click the [Colab Notebook link](#🔗-links) provided below.
2. Execute the notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom. This standalone notebook has everything configured to download the dataset and run the pipeline independently.
